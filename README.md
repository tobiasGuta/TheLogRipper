# TheLogRipper

**TheLogRipper** is an interactive PowerShell tool for parsing and analyzing Windows Event Log (`.evtx`) files. It extracts key fields, flags suspicious behavior, and offers export to JSON or CSV. Built for threat hunters, SOC analysts, and DFIR workflows.

## üîç Why Use TheLogRipper?

Because Event Viewer sucks when you're on a mission.

Manual `.evtx` analysis is slow, clunky, and frustrating. TheLogRipper gives you:
- CLI-based interaction
- Highlighted suspicious strings
- Fast extraction of useful metadata
- Optional export for offline analysis or reporting

Whether you're triaging a system post-breach or trying to track a specific type of event this is your drop-in forensic blade.

- Outputs full parsed event data in readable format
- Optional export to:
  - JSON (`TheLogRipper_output.json`)
  - CSV (`TheLogRipper_output.csv`)
- Compatible with PowerShell 5.1+ (no PowerShell 7 required)
